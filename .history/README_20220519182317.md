# **pycmm**

This package is used to control the Ti2 microscopes in SIAT. 
The commands for controlling Nikon microscope relay on package `pycromanager`, 
a package of MMCoreJ wrap of python, and some third-party devices which 
have a clear documented SDK was designed python interface for efficiency reasons.


Third-party devices including:

* Andor sCMOS camera
* myRIO trigger
