# **pycmm**

This package is used to control the Ti2 microscopes in SIAT. 
The commands for controlling Nikon microscope relay on package `pycromanager`, 
a package of MMCoreJ wrap of python, and some third-party devices which 
have a clear documented SDK was designed python interface for efficiency reasons.


Third-party devices including:
* Prior SDK python interface
* Andor sCMOS camera
* myRIO trigger



## **Device**

### **/device/NI_FPGA**

We use myRIO 19000 as the signal generator. The package `nifpga` is used for communicating myRIO.

- Register description

   `PulseNumberperLoop`: int, How much trigger signals (pulse) was trigger with one cycle.
   `BreakinLoop`: bool, default is False, if set `True`, it will disrupt current
